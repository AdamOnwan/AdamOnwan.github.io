    <p> Things I'm trying to add to this blog is: </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Have Java code run on this website</strong> so people that are not familiar with Java can see what the code does. Asking them to download something that can run java is too much, I want to make it simple for them to see. It seems difficult to do at the moment since I havent learned enough yet and online research is other people wondering too and no easy/real solutions, ex. <a href="https://itstillworks.com/put-java-application-8325779.html"> how to put java on github pages (this blog) </a> says to use applet which in another source it says applet does not work <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43917302/add-a-playable-java-swing-program-to-github-pages"> discussion onhow to put java on website </a> </li>
        <li> <strong>Have a comment box on the github pages (this website)</strong> and allow others to communicate to me with just having to enter there name and comment, simple comment box. Again its difficult, I have some form of comment box set up right now, but I think its having issues storing the information.</li></ol>
    <p> In this blog, I assume people visiting will be fullstack begineers like myself. I dislike small things somewhat related to coding bugging me, and they may bug you too, so I assume coding is easy for you but I want to provide you information you may not know about, so I'm going to go over things not really stressed in coding bootcamps or study material. Ex. Macbook basics, hotkeys, tricks, etc.</p>
    <p>
      Also, my IT experience is limited and really end user rather than programmer,
      such as operating message traffic terminals, cisco networks to ensure they
      running as intended. So basically ensuring the ship or station can communicate with other ships and stations. In other words, an end user that is <em>the one who brings the internet, the cloud</em>. So learning programing and being the one that makes processes, programs, etc. for end users should be interesting.</p>

    <p><strong>I know a little about HTML coding, just that h codes are important for
      listing on search engines. Digital marketing. Website crawlers come looking h codes?</strong></p>
      <p>___Below is me practicing programming for now___           ___________</p>
    <p> I use <a href="https://htmlcheatsheet.com"> online code editor</a> to preview the blogsite codes so I dont have to make a ton of commits. </p>
    <p>This is the <em>first</em><strong>paragraph</strong> on the page.</p>
    <p>This is the <em>second</em><strong>paragraph</strong> on the page.</p>
    <p><strong><em>This is both bold and italics</em></strong></p>

      <p> I want to make a chatbox/commentbox/forums, whatever .html only. So below was my attempt to make comment box, its broke, I think it needs a place to store info, I did some research and may have to tinker with jekyll or disquis. I have no idea what they are at the moment, I just keep seeing it in search and on blogs.</p>
