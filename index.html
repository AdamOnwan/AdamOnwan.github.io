    <p> In this blog, I'm going to go over things not really specified in coding bootcamps or study material.
      Ex. Macbook basics, hotkeys, tricks, etc.
      Also, my IT experience is limited and really end user rather than programmer,
      such as operating message traffic terminals, cisco networks to ensure they
      running as intended.
      My degrees is marketing and MBA, I will start out using github blog because
      this info is programming related and github is the place for programming blogs,
      but I enjoy marketing and business, and I think for those blogs, WordPress
      is the recommended blog site for that information.
      I've recently became Salesforce Certified Admin, 201, so I have understanding how
      programs should work, the catch is, Salesforce is all about clicks not code, and
      I'm now going into coding, and into the developer area.
      I hope Skills Distillery will help me get a developer job related to Salesforce,
      I know Salesforce uses Apex and not full stack line of codes, but what I know is
      once you learn a language the other languages come by easily, and helps learning
      another language like Apex.
    <p><strong>I know a little about HTML coding, just that h codes are important for
      listing on search engines.</strong></p>
