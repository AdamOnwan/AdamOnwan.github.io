    <h1>About</h1>
    <h2>Adam</h2>
    <p>I'm a Navy veteran who afterwards got his marketing degree at <a href="https://www.jwu.edu">Johnson and Wales University</a>, JWU, and MBA as well. I picked JWU because it does <a href="https://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/yellow_ribbon.asp">Yellow Ribbon program</a> 100% which means I can goto school out of state and they will pay along with VA the extra costs. Also that JWU has 4 campuses and they smack in the middle of downtown area, which is great when you want to experience living in different metro areas. I wanted to do marketing too, because I like to share ideas, do research, figure out the why of problems, and do something about it that benefits and takes care of the emerging issues. While at JWU I was a member of the advertising team as a researcher gathering information and partaking in discussions about advertising Snapple for the American Advertising Federation, AAF, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Student_Advertising_Competition">National Student Advertising Competition</a>, NSAC, collegiate contest which JWU placed 2nd districts that year.</p>
    <p>Now that college is over I've been looking for digital marketing, SaaS database type jobs. Like Google Analytics, Salesforce type work, unfortunately its tough to get into the industry. I wish graduating college and finding work was like military where I finish, IT "A" school and immediately start working as IT with no resume building, job searching required nor interviews and I just pick which job I want! In the Navy I picked Sicily, Italy as ones of my 3 places to work right after schooling and thats where they sent me. Anyways, recently I've been learning <a href="https://www.salesforce.com">Salesforce</a>, they have very good online learning platform called <a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com">Trailhead</a> and you learn other things besides Salesforce on their e-learning site, like Google Analytics to business related methodologies. Salesforce also has really good community, everyone I met so far that are into Salesforce are very nice and helpful, I've been to the Texas Dreamin and TrailheaDX events. There is also a military spouse, and veterans community called <a href="https://veterans.force.com/">VetForce</a>, I recommend joining it if you are a veteran or military spouse. I've had good progress with Salesforce, I feel like I could be working as an admin now because I'm somewhat recently certified 201 Salesforce Admin, and Trailhead tracks my progress which is a lot, I'm ranked 658 on the <a href="https://trailhead-leaderboard-developer-edition.na96.force.com">Trailhead unoffical leaderboard</a> as of 4 Sep, 2019.<p/>
    <p>However there is a new Veteran program called <a href="https://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/fgib/vettec.asp">VETTEC</a>, and its for people who are looking to start career in IT and haven't been in the industry yet (being IT in military don't count!), so now I'm about to partake in my programming journy at <a href="https://skilldistillery.com">Skill Distillery</a> in Denver. What I'm expecting out of this, is that I get credible/good job offers and get the job, I've been ready to start working for a long time!</p>
    <p>I feel like the person who knows the least so far, continue following if you want to see how something that is excited to learn but doesn't know that much right now is doing! Sorry I don't know how to make a follow button or commentbox at the moment. I did website managing in high school for <a href="https://www.fargo.k12.nd.us/domain/106">JROTC website</a>, but that was via a program and not raw .html from scratch. They still use same layout and application as when I was managing that site 10+ years ago, so I did good!</p>
